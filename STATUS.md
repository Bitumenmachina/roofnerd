# Status

Current as of 2026-09-07. One file, short. Patrick accepts against this whenever he chooses;
acceptance does not pause the build.

## Where the build is

**Section 1 — the trace surface: done.** Section 2 — the condition editor and the estimate
sheet — is next.

Section 0 (the skeleton) was built and pushed earlier the same day.

## What section 1 built

A drawing goes on screen and gets traced, and what comes off it is square feet, linear feet
and a count at the same time.

- **Drawings.** PDF pages and images (PNG, JPG, WEBP). The estimator picks a file; it is
  copied into the job folder and the job stores the path. The drawing is never copied into
  the job file — a job stays small, readable and greppable.
- **Scale.** Two points and a real dimension, typed the way a drawing writes it — `12'-6"`,
  `6"`, `4'-6 1/2"`, `12.5` all read the same. Or an architectural preset, 1/8" through 1".
  A sheet nobody has scaled says *unscaled*, and everything measured on it reads as pending
  rather than as zero.
- **Tools.** Area, line, count. Click to place, Enter or double-click to finish, Escape to
  drop it, Backspace to take back a corner, Shift to square up. Corners snap to corners
  already on the sheet, which is what stops a roof plan leaking area at every junction.
- **The conditions list**, live: `216.67 SF · 57.73 LF · 4 EA` off one traced area, with its
  pitch shown beside it.
- **Pitch does the work it is supposed to.** `PLAN_SF` is the footprint; `SF` is the sloped
  surface. A 12:12 roof is 41.4% more material than the plan says.
- **The formula language** an item line will carry: parsed to a tree and walked, never
  `eval`. `LF * H`, `ceil(LF * STRETCHOUT / 12 / 30)`, `LF * 2 / 0.5`. A formula that is
  wrong says what is wrong and where. A pending measure makes the answer pending — never
  zero, because a zero prices as a finished line for nothing.
- **`from:` inheritance.** A coping takes the parapet's measures instead of being traced
  twice, keeps its own properties, and the two can never drift. Circles are refused.

## What the checks say

| | |
|---|---|
| Section 1 done-check (`tools/probe/section1-trace.mjs`) | **PASS 12/12** — opens a PDF, scales it, traces an area with pitch, a run and a count, reads the measures off the list, confirms traces are stored in page units and the drawing is only referenced |
| Engine tests | **40/40** |
| Shell tests | **5/5**, including that a job saved by the application is byte-for-byte one saved by the command line |
| Vocabulary gate | **PASS** |
| Egress gate | **PASS** |
| Demo job round-trip | clean, 4 files |

## Defects found and fixed in flight

- **The document was keyed by file path.** A JSON Pointer splits on `/`, so `pages/pages.json`
  read as two steps and nothing could address it. It was latent in the Rust side too. The
  document is now keyed by part name. Found by the probe, which is what the probe is for.
- **pdf.js was asked to paint one canvas twice at once** — what leaning on the zoom key
  does. Paints are now cancellable and serialized, and the overlay is sized before the
  paint rather than after, so a trace sits in the right place while a big sheet is still
  drawing.
- **A drawing that failed to open said nothing.** It now says what went wrong.

## Since the last entry

Nine decisions in `DECISIONS.md` (D3–D9 are section 1's). One open question in
`QUESTIONS.md`: whether Edge's `EA` on a line condition counts corners or traced runs —
built as corners, and the section 3 fixture comparison will settle it against a real report.

## If Patrick wants to look

    cd ~/projects/roofnerd && pnpm dev

Add a drawing, set its scale, pick Area, trace a roof. The conditions list on the right
moves as you go. Then tear off the Estimate Sheet and put it on the other monitor.

To run what the executor ran:

    node tools/probe/section1-trace.mjs

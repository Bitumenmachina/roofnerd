# Status

Current as of 2026-09-07. One file, short. Patrick accepts against this whenever he chooses;
acceptance does not pause the build.

## Where the build is

**Sections 1 and 2 are done.** Section 3 — the money model: cost codes, classes, adders,
labor shapes, scenarios, waste, order units, the recap — is next.

Section 0 (the skeleton) was built and pushed earlier the same day.

## What section 1 built

A drawing goes on screen and gets traced, and what comes off it is square feet, linear feet
and a count at the same time.

- **Drawings.** PDF pages and images (PNG, JPG, WEBP). The estimator picks a file; it is
  copied into the job folder and the job stores the path. The drawing is never copied into
  the job file — a job stays small, readable and greppable.
- **Scale.** Two points and a real dimension, typed the way a drawing writes it — `12'-6"`,
  `6"`, `4'-6 1/2"`, `12.5` all read the same. Or an architectural preset, 1/8" through 1".
  A sheet nobody has scaled says *unscaled*, and everything measured on it reads as pending
  rather than as zero.
- **Tools.** Area, line, count. Click to place, Enter or double-click to finish, Escape to
  drop it, Backspace to take back a corner, Shift to square up. Corners snap to corners
  already on the sheet, which is what stops a roof plan leaking area at every junction.
- **The conditions list**, live: `216.67 SF · 57.73 LF · 4 EA` off one traced area, with its
  pitch shown beside it.
- **Pitch does the work it is supposed to.** `PLAN_SF` is the footprint; `SF` is the sloped
  surface. A 12:12 roof is 41.4% more material than the plan says.
- **The formula language** an item line will carry: parsed to a tree and walked, never
  `eval`. `LF * H`, `ceil(LF * STRETCHOUT / 12 / 30)`, `LF * 2 / 0.5`. A formula that is
  wrong says what is wrong and where. A pending measure makes the answer pending — never
  zero, because a zero prices as a finished line for nothing.
- **`from:` inheritance.** A coping takes the parapet's measures instead of being traced
  twice, keeps its own properties, and the two can never drift. Circles are refused.

## What section 2 built

The other half of the working loop, and the thing the whole program exists for: trace on
one screen, watch the money move on the other.

- **The condition panel** — a name, where its measures come from, and the six properties a
  roofing detail keeps asking for: height, width, thickness, pitch, sides, stretch-out. Any
  other number the estimator needs, they name themselves, and every formula on that
  condition can use it by that name. The panel also shows what the condition measures, so
  the numbers a formula will see are visible beside the formula.
- **The estimate sheet** — a line per item, grouped under the condition it comes off. The
  formula is printed on the line and edited there. Quantity, unit, waste, order units, unit
  cost, extended. A line with no price says *no price*; a line off an unscaled sheet says
  *pending*. Neither is ever counted as zero.
- **A bad formula says what is wrong and where**, on the line, and shows no quantity rather
  than a plausible one.
- **One trace, several units.** A parapet traced once feeds wall flashing in SF, coping in
  LF and corners in EA, and all three move together.

## What the checks say

| | |
|---|---|
| Section 1 done-check (`tools/probe/section1-trace.mjs`) | **PASS 12/12** — opens a PDF, scales it, traces an area with pitch, a run and a count, reads the measures off the list, confirms traces are stored in page units and the drawing is only referenced |
| Section 2 done-check (`tools/probe/section2-sheet.mjs`) | **PASS 16/16** — traces a parapet, types a height in the panel, tears the sheet into a second window, adds three items in three units, then changes the drawing and the height and watches the money move in the OTHER window. Two windows, one job, throughout |
| Engine tests | **54/54** |
| Shell tests | **5/5**, including that a job saved by the application is byte-for-byte one saved by the command line |
| Vocabulary gate | **PASS** |
| Egress gate | **PASS** |
| Demo job round-trip | clean, 4 files |

## Defects found and fixed in flight

- **The document was keyed by file path.** A JSON Pointer splits on `/`, so `pages/pages.json`
  read as two steps and nothing could address it. It was latent in the Rust side too. The
  document is now keyed by part name. Found by the probe, which is what the probe is for.
- **pdf.js was asked to paint one canvas twice at once** — what leaning on the zoom key
  does. Paints are now cancellable and serialized, and the overlay is sized before the
  paint rather than after, so a trace sits in the right place while a big sheet is still
  drawing.
- **A drawing that failed to open said nothing.** It now says what went wrong.
- **Floating-point crumbs bought an extra roll.** `100` with 10% waste is
  `110.00000000000001`, and a bare `ceil` made that twelve rolls instead of eleven. An
  estimator would have found it by counting the pallet. Quantities now settle before they
  meet a rounding step, and a test pins it.
- **The formula column clipped its own contents** — the one thing on the sheet that must
  never be cut off.

## Since the last entry

Fourteen decisions in `DECISIONS.md` (D3–D9 section 1, D10–D14 section 2). One open
question in `QUESTIONS.md`: whether Edge's `EA` on a line condition counts corners or traced
runs — built as corners, and the section 3 fixture comparison will settle it against a real
report.

## If Patrick wants to look

    cd ~/projects/roofnerd && pnpm dev

Add a drawing, set its scale, pick Line, trace a parapet. Click it in the list and type a
height into the panel. Tear off the Estimate Sheet, put it on the other monitor, and add a
line with the formula `LF * H`. Then go back to the drawing and trace another run of the
same parapet — the money moves while you are still on the first screen.

To run what the executor ran:

    node tools/probe/section1-trace.mjs
    node tools/probe/section2-sheet.mjs
